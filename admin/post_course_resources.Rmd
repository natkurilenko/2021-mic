# Overview
1. [Personal Notebooks](#Maintaining-Personal-Files): Downloading notebooks that you modified
2. [MIC Course Material](#Accessing-Course-Material): Downloading official course material: notebooks, lecture slides, etc
3. [Course Data](#Course-Data): How to download the data we used in the MIC Course
5. [MIC Computing Environment](#MIC-Computing-Environment): Downloading and running the HTS Image in Docker or Singularity

# High Priority

If you have **created or modified files** in your Jupyter container that you would like to preserve, we recommend that you follow the instructions for [Maintaining Personal Files](#Maintaining-Personal-Files).
-   We recommend you do this before *as soon as possible*, certainly by July 2nd, 2021. After July 2nd, 2021 the container system we used during the course will be shut down.
-   Keep in mind that you only need to worry about this for files that you have  **created or modified**.  The course material that we created and shared with you will continue to be publicly available.

Here are instruction to [download the gene count tables]()

## Important Notes

See details below, but please keep the following in mind:
1.  The course material will remain in the [2021 MIC Course Gitlab Repository](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/2021-mic) and will be publicly available, in perpetuity (or as long as <https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/> continues to exist), regardless of your affiliation with Duke (or lack thereof). See below for details.
2.  The configuration and build information for the course Docker container will remain in the [Jupyter MIC 2021 Gitlab Repository](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021) and will be publicly available, in perpetuity (or as long as <https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/> continues to exist), regardless of your affiliation with Duke (or lack thereof).
3. The 2021 MIC Jupyter Docker image will remain in the [Jupyter MIC 2021 DockerHub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/miccourse/jupyter-mic-2021) and will be publicly available, in perpetuity (or as long as <https://hub.docker.com> continues to exist and host free repositories), regardless of your affiliation with Duke (or lack thereof).

# Maintaining Personal Files

## Tar and Download

### Tarring


#### Tarring: Only Notebooks
If you only want to get *notebooks and shell scripts*, you could use the following to only grab the notebooks from 2021-mic. This will skip a lot of stuff you probably don't want. This archive file will be in your home directory and will be named 2021-mic-notebooks.tar.gz
<!-- #endregion -->

```{bash}
find ~/2021-mic  \
    -not -path "*/.ipynb_checkpoints/*" \
    -name "*.Rmd" \
    -o -name "*.sh" \
    | tar -cvzf ~/2021-mic-notebooks.tar.gz -T -
```

#### Tarring: Only Notebooks with a common name

If you want only modified notebooks **and** you saved them with a standard naming scheme, e.g. leaving `-Copy1` in the name, for example, renaming `demultiplex.Rmd` to `demultiplex-Copy1.Rmd`, you could use the following to only grab the modified files from 2021-mic

```{bash}
find ~/2021-mic \
    -name "*-Copy1*" \
    -not -path "*/.ipynb_checkpoints/*" \
    | tar -cvzf ~/2021-mic-copy1.tar.gz -T -
```

### Downloadng the tarball

Now you can do one of the following to download the tarball to your laptop. 

1. Click on the "Jupyter" logo above to open the Jupyter file browser
2. Naviagte your way to the directory where you saved the tarball.  The tarball should be in the toplevel directory, which is usually what opens when you click the Jupyter logo, but if not, you can click on the folder icon near the top of the file browser
3. Click the checkbox next to `2021-mic-notebooks.tar.gz`
4. Click the *Download* button near the top of the Jupyter window to download it.

### Unpacking the tarball
On a Mac you can "untar" by double clicking on the file in finder, or at the terminal with the command `tar -zxf 2021-mic-notebooks.tar.gz`.

On Windows, you can download software that will do it, such as [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)

> If you named your tarball, you should substitute whatever name you used above.

# Accessing Course Material

You can access the course material in three different ways:
1.  You can browse and download the material from the [2021 MIC Course Repository](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/2021-mic) by clicking on the Download button, which is right next to the blue **Clone** button. It will give you a choice of format you want. The best options are probably "zip" or "tar.gz"
2.  You can **clone** the repo using git: `git clone https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/2021-mic.git`

# Course Data
The data we used in the 2021 MIC course was from GEO Accession number GSE159344.  The FASTQ files were downloaded from SRA and the metadata table was built using information from GEO and SRA. Both of these were done with the [download_data_sra.Rmd](../bioinformatics/setup/download_data_sra.Rmd) script.


# MIC Computing Environment
The computing environment that we used in the MIC course was based on a Docker image. The MIC Course Docker image is available [here on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/miccourse/jupyter-mic-2021). If you install Docker, the image can be downloaded with the command `docker pull miccourse/jupyter-mic-2021:2021_final`.  The Dockerfile (i.e. recipe) used to build it is in the [Jupyter MIC 2021 GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021). 

There are detailed instuctions on the [Jupyter MIC 2021 GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021) for several different ways to run this computing environment:

1. [Run on a SLURM cluster](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021#running-the-course-image-on-a-slurm-cluster), like the [Duke Computer Cluster](https://rc.duke.edu/dcc/).
2. [Run on your local computer](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021#run-image-on-your-local-computer)
3. If you are at Duke, you can run things on the Duke Computer Cluster by cloning the git repo and cd'ing into the course repo directory, then following the [Run on a SLURM cluster](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mic-course/jupyter-MIC-2021#running-the-course-image-on-a-slurm-cluster) instructions, but substituting the following for the command in step 3
```
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="/work/${USER}/singularity_cache"; srun --cpus-per-task=20 --mem=50G admin/run_singularity/run_singularity_jupyter.sh
```

> It takes about 40GB of RAM to run the notebooks as they are. It might be less if you run with fewer threads.
