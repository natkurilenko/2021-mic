## Shell Variables
Assign the variables in this notebook.

```{bash}
set -u

DATA_BASE="/data"
RAW_FASTQ_DIR="$DATA_BASE/sra_data"

# The following are new for this notebook
CUROUT=$HOME/scratch/bioinf_intro
QC=$CUROUT/qc_output

TOTAL_THREADS=20
```

## Making New Directories
The directories *do* carry over between notebooks, they are a function of the server, so we only need to make the directories that are new in this notebook

```{bash}
mkdir -p $QC
```

Now let's check to be sure that worked.  We will run `ls` and check that these directories now exist in the `$OUTPUT` directory.

```{bash}
ls $CUROUT
```

## Fastqc
Now that we have had a quick look at our fastq file, let's run some basic analysis using a program called fastqc.  This will take less than a minute to run.  Remember that while "long" jobs are running it will say "In [\*]:" in the left margin, once it is done, a number will replace the asterisk.

```{bash}
fastqc -h
```

```{bash}
ls -lSrh $RAW_FASTQ_DIR
```

```{bash}
# fastqc --threads 2 --quiet $DEMUX/r1.8A_pilot.fq.gz -o $QC
fastqc --threads $TOTAL_THREADS --extract $RAW_FASTQ_DIR/SRR12804466_1.fastq.gz -o $QC
```

Once fastqc is done running we can view the results by finding the output in the Jupyter browser, it should be in:

```{bash}
echo $QC
```

## MultiQC
FastQC is a useful tool, but it has one problem: it generates one report for each FASTQ file.  When you have more than a handful of FASTQs (as most projects will), it is tedious to look at each one, and there is no simple way to compare them.

MultiQC is a solution to this problem.  It mines the results from FastQC (and other HTS analysis tools) and generates reports that combine and summarize results for all the FASTQs analyzed.

### Run FastQC on Multiple FASTQs
Let's pick a selection of FASTQs to look at.

```{bash}
ls $RAW_FASTQ_DIR/SRR1280446[456]_1.fastq.gz
```

`--threads $TOTAL_THREADS` tells fastqc to run using `$TOTAL_THREADS` cores.

```{bash}
fastqc --quiet --threads $TOTAL_THREADS --extract $RAW_FASTQ_DIR/SRR1280446[457]_1.fastq.gz -o $QC
```

### Run MultiQC

```{bash}
multiqc -h
```

```{bash}
multiqc $QC --outdir $QC
```

```{bash}
multiqc -h
```

Once multiqc is done running we can view the results by finding the output in the Jupyter browser, it should be in a file named `multiqc_report.html` in :

```{bash}
echo $QC
```
