## Shell Variables
Assign the variables in this notebook.

```{bash}
# Source the config script
source bioinf_config.sh

mkdir -p ${PE_QC}
ls $PE_OUT_DIR
```

## Fastqc
Now that we have had a quick look at our fastq file, let's run some basic analysis using a program called fastqc.  This will take less than a minute to run.  Remember that while "long" jobs are running it will say "In [\*]:" in the left margin, once it is done, a number will replace the asterisk.

```{bash}
# fastqc --threads 2 --quiet $DEMUX/r1.8A_pilot.fq.gz -o $QC
fastqc --threads $TOTAL_THREADS --extract $RAW_FASTQ_DIR/SRR12804466_[12].fastq.gz -o $PE_QC
```

## MultiQC

```{bash}
multiqc $PE_QC $PE_STAROUT_DIR --outdir $PE_QC
```

Once multiqc is done running we can view the results by finding the output in the Jupyter browser, it should be in a file named `multiqc_report.html` in :

```{bash}
echo $PE_QC
```
