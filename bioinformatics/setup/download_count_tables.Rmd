If you want to have a local copy of the gene count tables generated by STAR

cp /data/count_tables.tgz ~/scratch
```

2. Click on the Jupyter logo to get to the Jupyter file browser
3. Open your scratch directory
4. Click the checkbox next to **count_tables.tgz**
5. Click the **Download Button** (near the top of the Jupyter file browser)
6. Unpack the downloaded **count_tables.tgz** file on your local computer
    - In MacOS you should be able to double click on the file
    - In Windows you might need to install software to unpack it. One program that will work is [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
