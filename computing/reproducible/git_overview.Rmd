## Why Git
* Popular
* Powerful
* Distributed
* Free
* Open Source

# Using Git with Jupyter
The most straightforward way to use git in Jupyter is through the terminal. Except where noted, everything we do in this tutorial will be done in the Jupyter terminal (**NOT** in a bash notebook).

> Note: RStudio provides a nice GUI for using git, which can reduce the git learning curve. There is an [RStudio version of this tutorial](git_in_rstudio.Rmd).
	
## Configure Git
1. Go to the Jupyter Terminal
2. First we need to do a bit of configuration. Run the following commands, replacing "you@example.com" and "Your Name" with your information.
```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
3. You can confirm that you successful configured your name and email with this command: `git config --list`

## Create a New Repo
A local git repository consist of a directory and all of its contents (including subdirectories). When you make a directory into a repository, git makes a hidden subdirectory (named `.git`) where it keeps files that it needs to do its job; you should *never touch  this directory or its contents*

Let's create a new repository!

1. Create a new subdirectory in your home directory with `mkdir ~/planets`
2. Change into the new directory with `cd ~/planets`
3. Make the planets directory into a repository with `git init`
4. Name the default branch "main" `git checkout -b main`
4. Confirm that the current directory is a git repo with `git status`, which should print the following

```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```


## Tracking Changes

STOPPED HERE

#### Adding a New File
1. Make a new text file in the **planets** project.
2. Add some text: "Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color"
3. Save as `mars.txt`.
4. Notice that `mars.txt` is now in the Git pane.  The two question
   marks under **Status** mean that git doesn't know anything about
   this file (and is not responsible for it)
5. Click the checkbox under **Staged** to add the file to the repo,
notice that **Status** changes to "A" (for "added").
6. Now click **Commit** to open the **Review Changes** dialog, put in the
   commit message "Start notes on Mars as a base", commit the
   file, and close the dialog boxes.
7. To see our project history, click on the clock icon in the Git pane.

#### Making changes
1. Add a second line to `mars.txt`: "The two moons may be a problem
for Wolfman" and save.
2. Notice that `mars.txt` pops up again in the **Git** pane with an
**M** for "modified".
3. Click on the **Diff** button to open the **Review Changes**
   dialog. It shows us the line we added highlighted in green, and
   shows us the unchanged previous line in gray.
4. To commit these changes to git, add the commit message "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons
on Wolfman", click **Commit**. Notice the error message from git:

```
Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit
```

Git messages are usually very informative! Git is telling us that we
can't commit because we didn't *add* anything to the commit!  We
forgot to click the **Staged** button.

So, now click on the **Staged** checkbox, be sure our commit message
is still there,  click **Commit**, check the message from git, then close the dialogs.

#### Staging
Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than only large batches. For example, suppose we’re adding a few citations to our supervisor’s work to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding addition to the bibliography, but not commit the work we’re doing on the conclusion (which we haven’t finished yet).

To allow for this, Git has a special staging area where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current changeset but not yet committed.

> ##### Staging Area
> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, git add specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and git commit then actually takes the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). If you don’t have anything staged when you type git commit, Git will prompt you to use git commit -a or git commit --all, which is kind of like gathering everyone for the picture! However, it’s almost always better to explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to snapshots, you might get the extra with incomplete makeup walking on the stage for the snapshot because you used -a!) Try to stage things manually, or you might find yourself searching for “git undo commit” more than you would like!

Let's examine this process more carefully . . .

1. Add a third line to `mars.txt`: "But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
" and save.
2. Open the **Review Changes** dialog.
3. Notice that the **Show: Unstaged** button is checked. We can toggle
   between viewing staged changes and unstaged changes by clicking on
   the buttons next to **Show: Staged** and **Show: Unstaged**.  Right now no
   changes are staged.
4. Click on the **Staged** button next to `mars.txt` to stage the
   changes.  Notice that **Show: Staged** is automatically selected,
   but we can flip back to **Show: Unstaged** to see that there are no
   longer any unstaged changes.
5. Add the commit message "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy", click **Commit**, check the message from git, then close the dialogs.
6. Now we can check the history and see the changes made at each
commit and the commit message.

#### Challenge: Choosing a Commit Message
Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the last commit made to mars.txt?

1. “Changes”
2. “Added line ‘But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity’ to
mars.txt”
3. “Discuss effects of Mars’ climate on the Mummy”

### Reverting Changes

"If I could turn back time . . ." -- Cher

One of the key benefits of using version control is the ability to do
something not usually possible in life - going back in time.  Lot's of
software has **Undo**, but when version control is used well, it is
like an infinite super-duper undo with a safety net.

#### Basic Reversion
1. Add a forth line to `mars.txt`: "An ill-considered change" and save.
2. Open the **Review Changes** dialog.
3. If we want to get rid of this change, we can click the **Revert**
button, then click **Yes** . . . voila!

#### Revert Some Changes, but not All
1. Add a these two lines `mars.txt`:
```
No wind
A little bit dusty
```
2. Open the **Review Changes** dialog.
3. Oops, it turns out that there **is** wind on mars, so we need to
revert line 4, but commit line 5!
4. Click on "No wind" to select it, then click **Discard line**.
5. Now click on **Stage All** to add the remaining line, add a commit
   message and commit

#### Going Further Back
Git is super powerful!  It will let you do all sorts of things.  For example, you can revert some or all files back to any previous commit . . . but you cannot access all of git's features with the RStudio interface.  To do fancier things you have to use the command line interface.  Within RStudio you can do this using the **Terminal** under the **Tools** menu.  The Software Carpentry module [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) covers this, and google will help you figure out how to do just about anything with git.

### Ignoring Things

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis. Let’s create a few dummy files! Make new text files with the following names (you can leave them empty): 
```
a.dat
b.dat
c.dat
results/a.out
results/b.out
```

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What’s worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let’s tell Git to ignore them.

RStudio makes this pretty easy to do:

1. Click on the `a.dat` file in the git pane to select it.
2. Click on the gear in the git pane (it might say "More" next to it), and select **Ignore**.  This will open a **Git ignore** dialog box with a list of files that git is ignoring, with `a.dat` added to the list (the others were automatically added by RStudio when we made this project).
3. Click on **save** to accept the addition of `a.dat` to the list. 
> Notice that `a.dat` has now disappeared from the git pane, but `.gitignore` has just appeared as modified.  `.gitignore` is the file where we specify what git should ignore - that **Git ignore** dialog box was actually a mini text editor, and by adding `a.dat` we changed the file (you may remember that the first thing we did after creating the **planets** project was to commit `.gitignore` to the repo).

4. What about the other `.dat` files? Select `b.dat` in the git pane then open the **Git ignore** dialog.  Now replace "a.dat" and "b.dat" with "*.dat", this will tell git to ignore *any* file that ends in ".dat"
5. Let's also add `results` directory, but it is a good idea to add it as "results/", the forward slash at the end means that we are specifically refering to a directory (and its contents)
6. Now lets stage and commit our changes to `.gitignore`
> Sometimes you will want to include `.gitignore` in the repo, and sometimes you won't.  In cases where you don't want to include it in the repo, you will want to add ".gitignore" to the list of files to ignore in `.gitignore`, which is very meta!

Now let's work through the challenges at the end of [Version Control with Git: 6. Ignoring Things](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html)

# Remote Git Repository

## Why a Remote Repository
* Collaborate
* Remote backup
* Share/Publish

## Setup SSH Key

### Create Key in RStudio
1. Go to Global Options (from the Tools menu)
2. Click Git/SVN
3. Click **Create RSA Key**
4. Enter a passphrase (Optional)
5. Click **Create**
6. Click **View public key**
7. Select and copy all the text in the box
8. Follow these instructions to
	[Add an SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/), starting with step #2.

## Remotes in GitHub

1. Follow  [Version Control with Git: 7. Remotes in GitHub](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/) through where it says "The next step is to connect the two repositories. We do this by making the GitHub repository a remote for the local repository. The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it:"
2. In Github, under "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before", click on "SSH"
3. Below that, copy the text in the section **. . . or push an existing repository from the command line** by clicking on the "copy to clipboard" button on the right side.
3. In RStudio, open the Terminal (in the **Tools** menu)
4. Paste the command you copied from Github.  It should look like this (except your github username should be there instead of "GITHUB_USER_NAME"):
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:GITHUB_USER_NAME/planets.git
git push -u origin master
```
If you entered a passphrase when you generated your SSH key, you will be prompted to enter it.
> The "git remote . . ." command associates your local repo with the repo you just made on Github.  The "git push . . ." command pushes everything from your local repo to the Github repo. Now the Github repo should be a perfect copy of your local repo.

5. Let's check that these two commands worked . . . go to your Github account in your webbrower and click on "planets" near the top.  You should see the three files that we commited to our local repo: `.gitignore`, `mars.txt`, and `planets.Rproj`
6. Let's add another line to `mars.txt` in RStudio: "Rhymes with cars". Then stage and commit it.
7. Notice that near the top of the **Review Changes** dialog it now says "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.".  This is because we have commited local changes, but haven't updated our remote repo (on Github).  Let's sync the remote repo by clicking the **Push** button.  Check on Github for the changes!

Do the following challenges from the bottom of [Version Control with Git: 7. Remotes in GitHub](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/):

  * GitHub GUI
  * Push vs. Commit

## Collaborating

### Cloning someone else's repo
For the next step, get into pairs. One person will be the “Owner” and the other will be the “Collaborator”. The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into the Owner’s repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will play Owner and Collaborator.

#### Github Setup
1. The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access. The owner needs to find their repository on GitHub, click the settings button on the right, then select Collaborators, and enter your partner’s username.
![Github Collaborator Settings](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/github-add-collaborators.png)
2. To accept access to the Owner’s repo, the Collaborator needs to go to https://github.com/notifications. Once there she can accept access to the Owner’s repo. If nothing shows up there, the collaborator should check their email to see if they received an email notification.

#### Cloning the Repository
 Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner’s repository to her machine. This is called “cloning a repo”. The Collaborator will clone the repo in RStudio by starting a new project.

1. To get the URL for the Owner's repository, the Collaborator should go to the Owner’s repository on Github and click the green *Clone or download* button.  In the dialog box that pops up, be sure it says "Clone with SSH", then copy the Repository URL (it should be `git@github.com:OWNER_GITHUB_USERNAME/planet.git`, but with the Owner's Github username instead of "OWNER_GITHUB_USERNAME")
2. In RStudio select the New Project command from the Project menu.
3. Choose to create a new project from Version Control
4. Choose Git
5. Fill in the *Repository URL*: that you just copied from Github
6. For *Project directory name* put `planet_shared`
7. Leave *Create project as subdirectory of* as "~"
8. Click Create Project.  

### Modifying someone else's repo
Now the Collaborator (i.e. not the owner) can now make a change in the clone of the Owner’s repository, exactly the same way as we’ve been doing before . . .

1. Make a new text file and put in the text "It is so a planet!" and save as `pluto.txt`
2. Stage `pluto.txt`, and commit it with the message "Add notes about Pluto"
3. Push the change to the Owner’s repository on GitHub by clicking the **Push** button
> Note that we didn’t have to create a remote called origin: Git uses this name by default when we clone a repository. (This is why origin was a sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

4. Take a look to the Owner’s repository on its GitHub website now (maybe you need to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the Collaborator.
5. To download the Collaborator’s changes from GitHub, the Owner should clicking the **Pull** button in their own RStudio. Now the three repositories (Owner’s local, Collaborator’s local, and Owner’s on GitHub) are back in sync.
6. Switch roles, whoever was Owner first time around should repeat this as Collaborator, and vice versa.

#### > A Basic Collaborative Workflow
> In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the repository you are collaborating on, so you should git pull before making our changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:
> 
> 1. update your local repo with git pull origin master
> 2. make your changes and stage them
> 3. commit your changes
> 4. upload the changes to GitHub with git push

> It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than of one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to read and review.

#### Challenges
##### Review Changes
The Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information to the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with Rstudio? And on GitHub?

##### Comment Changes in GitHub

The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and has some suggestions to propose.

With GitHub, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.

The Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using GitHub interface.

##### Version History, Backup, and Version Control

Some backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also allows you to recover specific versions. How is this functionality different from version control? What are some of the benifits of using version control, Git and GitHub?
